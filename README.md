## 📌 Business Context
The company operates a **Global E-Commerce Business** serving customers across multiple regions. While overall revenue performance appears stable, **Business Management** has raised concerns about uneven profitability across regions. Preliminary observations suggest that certain regions generate high order volume but contribute disproportionately low or negative profit. As a **Business Data Analyst**, this project aims to evaluate whether regional shipping costs are a key driver behind the observed profit decline and to support decisions on optimizing the regional shipping strategy.

**Dashboard :** 

<br>


## 📌 Decision Statement
Determine whether the company should optimize, adjust, or partially reduce regional shipping subsidies to improve overall profitability.

<br>


## 📌 Problem Hypothesis
High shipping costs in certain regions are eroding profit margins, causing those regions to underperform financially despite stable or growing revenue.

<br>

## 📌 Business Question
1️⃣ Which regions are underperforming in terms of profitability?

2️⃣ How significant is shipping cost relative to revenue across regions?

3️⃣ Is higher shipping cost associated with lower profit margins in certain regions?

4️⃣ Are profit losses concentrated in a small number of regions with high shipping costs?

5️⃣ Which regions present the highest potential for margin improvement if shipping costs are optimized?

<br>

## 📌 Metrics & Definitions
**Revenue :** Total sales value per order / region


**Profit :** Total profit value per order / region


**Profit Margin :** Profit / Revenue


**Shipping Cost :** Total shipping expense per order / region


**Shipping Cost Ratio :** Shipping Cost / Revenue

**Delivery Mode / Priority :** Ship Mode by region

## 📌 Key Insights
1️⃣ Profitability is highly concentrated in a small number of countries, while several regions consistently generate losses.

2️⃣ Loss-making countries are constrained by structural cost inefficiencies rather than insufficient demand.

3️⃣ Shipping cost per order is globally consistent. however, its impact is disproportionately damaging in low-revenue regions.

4️⃣ Premium shipping modes significantly increase cost per order without delivering proportional profit uplift.

5️⃣ Overuse of Same Day and First Class shipping particularly in Guatemala emerges as a primary driver of margin erosion.

6️⃣ Unit-level profitability analysis confirms that Same Day shipping is economically unsustainable in low-margin markets.

## 📌 Business Recommendation
🔹 **Recommendation 1 — Restrict Premium Shipping in Low-Margin Regions**

Limit Same Day and First Class shipping options in Guatemala and Ukraine, where unit-level profitability is consistently negative.

🔹 **Recommendation 2 — Introduce Order-Value Thresholds**

Enable premium shipping only for orders exceeding a defined revenue threshold to ensure cost recovery.

🔹 **Recommendation 3 — Default to Cost-Efficient Fulfillment**

Position Standard and Second Class shipping as default fulfillment options in low-margin regions.

🔹 **Recommendation 4 — Regional Fulfillment Policy**

Implement region-specific shipping policies rather than a uniform global approach to better align logistics costs with regional revenue potential.
